	The Jewish [mfer] {{index .CmdArgs 0}} who, Iâ€™m glad to say, is leaving at the end of this week, has happily lost another 5,000 talers in an ill-judged speculation. The chap would sooner throw money down the drain than lend it to a â€˜friendâ€™, even though his interest and capital were guaranteed. In this he bases himself on the view that he ought to live the life of a Jewish baron, or Jew created a baron (no doubt by the countess). Just imagine! This fellow, knowing about the American affair, etc., and hence about the state of crisis Iâ€™m in, had the insolence to ask me whether I would be willing to hand over one of my daughters to la Hatzfeldt as a â€˜companionâ€™, and whether he himself should secure Gerstenbergâ€™s (!) patronage for me! The fellow has wasted my time and, what is more, the dolt opined that, since I was not engaged upon any â€˜businessâ€™ just now, but merely upon a â€˜theoretical workâ€™, I might just as well kill time with him! In order to keep up certain dehors vis-Ã -vis the fellow, my wife had to put in pawn everything that wasnâ€™t actually nailed or bolted down!

	{{index .CmdArgs 0}} has become a monster, a huge mass of flesh and fat, and is barely capable of walking any more. To crown it all, he is sexually perverse and jealous of the seventeen year-old Polish girl who married him in Siberia because of his martyrdom. He is presently in Sweden, where he is hatching â€˜revolutionâ€™ with the Finns.
